## üì¶Installation

 - Clone the repository:

 - **Option 1: Using HTTPS**
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/wallet-frontend.git
     ```

## üîêPRF Compatibility

The wwWallet Frontend is designed to be compatible with the PRF extension to WebAuthn, ensuring a streamlined and secure registration and authentication process. Below, we present specific compatibility scenarios based on the operating system, emphasizing both WebAuthn and PRF extension compatibility.

### Compatibility Description

The PRF (Pseudo Random Function) extension in WebAuthn enables the evaluation of a hash message authentication code stored on the security key during the retrieval of a credential. This mechanism is crucial for generating secret keys vital for encrypting user data. While WebAuthn supports various authentication methods, the focus of this table is the compatibility with the PRF extension.

### PRF Compatibility Scenarios Support by Operating System and Latest Browser Versions

<sup>[1]</sup> **Note on Android with FIDO Security Keys over USB:** It's essential to have **Google Play Services (GPS) version 24.08.12 or later**.

***Notes:**
- In this table, we use the term "FIDO Security Key" to refer to compatible security keys. It's important to understand that any security key should work with the hmac-secret extension, provided it supports this feature.
For a detailed list of security key models that support hmac-secret, you can refer to the [FIDO MDS Explorer](https://opotonniee.github.io/fido-mds-explorer/), where hmac-secret support is listed under metadataStatement > authenticatorGetInfo > extensions.*
- The **PRF extension is supported in Mozilla Firefox on iOS only in internal cases** because Firefox generally uses the Gecko engine, but on iOS, it is required for all browsers to run on WebKit.
- iOS supports PRF extension starting with the **iOS 18** release.

The wwWallet is committed to delivering a secure and adaptable authentication experience with an emphasis on PRF extension compatibility.

## üî•Firebase
This application uses Firebase for authentication and messaging features. To integrate Firebase into your project, follow these steps:

1. **Firebase Configuration (`src/firebase.js`):**

	The `firebase.js` file in the `src` directory and provide your Firebase configuration details. This file initializes the Firebase app and sets up the messaging service.

2. **Firebase Messaging Service Worker (`public/firebase-messaging-sw.js`):**

   This service worker is responsible for handling background messages and notification clicks. When a background message is received, it triggers a notification, and when the user clicks on a notification, it can perform custom actions.

## üé®Tailwind CSS

This project utilizes **Tailwind CSS**, a utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid development of custom user interfaces with minimal effort. Tailwind CSS offers a collection of utility classes that make styling components and layouts a breeze, eliminating the need for writing extensive custom CSS.

### Styling with Utility Classes

To apply styles using Tailwind CSS, you can directly add utility classes to your HTML or JSX components. For example, to apply padding, margin, text color, and more:

```html
<div class="p-4 m-2 text-blue-500">Styled with Tailwind CSS</div>
```
### Customization
Tailwind CSS provides an extensive set of default styles, but you can also customize them to match your project's design. The **tailwind.config.js** file in the project's root directory allows you to customize colors, fonts, spacing, breakpoints, and more.

### Learn More
Explore the [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) to learn about all the utility classes, configuration options, and techniques for building beautiful UIs efficiently.
